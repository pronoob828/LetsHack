        Welcome to Penpals: Your Online Learning Community
    </h5>
    <p>
        At Penpals, we believe that learning should be a collaborative and self-paced experience. We understand that
        every
        learner has unique needs and preferences, which is why we have created a platform that empowers individuals to
        create their own discussion rooms for learning skills. Whether you are a student, professional, or lifelong
        learner,
        Penpals provides you with a vibrant online community to connect, share knowledge, and grow together.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our platform is designed to offer an immersive learning environment where you can find discussion rooms on a
        wide
        range
        of topics. From programming languages to music theory, from photography techniques to culinary arts, you'll
        discover
        a
        diverse collection of rooms created by passionate learners like yourself. With Penpals, you can explore your
        interests,
        find like-minded individuals, and engage in meaningful discussions that enhance your learning journey.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the unique features of Penpals is the ability to create posts within discussion rooms. These posts allow
        you
        to
        share valuable insights, ask questions, and contribute to ongoing conversations. To ensure a seamless reading
        experience, we support Markdown language, which enables you to format your posts and make them neat and tidy.
        With
        Markdown, you can easily add headers, lists, links, and other formatting elements to make your content more
        engaging
        and
        visually appealing.
    </p>

    <p>

        Penpals aims to provide a roadmap and content under one umbrella. Within each discussion room, you'll find
        subtopics
        that break down the broader subject into manageable sections. These subtopics act as milestones in your learning
        journey, helping you navigate through the vast sea of knowledge with ease. Each subtopic contains curated
        resources,
        such as articles, videos, tutorials, and recommended books, to provide you with comprehensive learning materials
        all
        in
        one place.
    </p>

    <p>

        Whether you prefer self-paced learning or enjoy collaborating with others, Penpals has something to offer. Our
        discussion rooms are open to learners of all levels, from beginners to experts, allowing you to connect with
        individuals
        who share your passion and enthusiasm for a particular skill. You can learn from their experiences, seek advice,
        and
