## Penpals

Penpals is website where you can learn and teach new skills,

Traditional Classrooms do not allow us to learn at our own pace

And it's not the fault of the teachers, They have to walk with the whole class (sometimes crawl).

And even then, some students get bored and some get left behind.

*The solution*

###Penpal

Rooms can be created for any topic, and posts can be created for its subtopics.
